<p>On behalf of the Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC), I would like
to extend my warmest congratulations to all student-athletes who have been
selected to represent Singapore Schools Sports Team (SSST) at the 13th
ASEAN Schools Games (ASG) to be held in Da Nang, Vietnam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ASG is a valuable platform that allows student-athletes to showcase
their talents and compete against the best in the region. It is also an
opportunity for them to learn from their peers, make new friends and gain
valuable experiences that will stay with them for life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student-athletes, I encourage you to embrace this opportunity to compete
with passion and sportsmanship, and to represent SSST with pride and distinction.
I am confident that you will strive to do your best. Let’s not forget the
National School Games motto – Character in Sporting Excellence – and bring
it with us to every sporting arena, making Singapore proud not just with
your performances but also your inspiring sportsmanship. I wish you all
the best for the competition, and I look forward to seeing you return home
with new experiences, friendships and memories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to thank NYSI, coaches, officials and parents who are
supporting the student-athletes on their journey. Your hard work and dedication
enable the student-athletes to enjoy this experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish everyone a safe, exciting and meaningful 13<sup>th</sup> ASG. Let
the games begin!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr Justin Arul Pierre</strong>&nbsp;
<br><strong>Chairperson</strong>&nbsp;
<br><strong>Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC)</strong>&nbsp;</p></div>
