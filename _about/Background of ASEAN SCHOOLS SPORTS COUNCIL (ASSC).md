<p>Prior to 1978, four ASEAN countries comprising Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore
and Malaysia met and discussed the formation of a sports body that would
govern all sports programmes and activities for school children of the
ASEAN countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In April 1978, the ASSC was formed during a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia.
The founding members of the ASSC are Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and
Thailand. The current 109-member ASSC includes Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia,
Laos, Philippines, and Vietnam and Myanmar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2004, an ASSC secretariat was formed. Each member country was to preside
over the chairmanship of the Games on two-year terms. It was decided during
a Technical Committee Meeting in Malaysia in 2007 that the ASSC sports
calendar activities will be held yearly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2008, the ASSC celebrated its 30th Anniversary at the ASEAN Schools
Sports Council 58th Technical Committee Meeting and 45th Management Committee
Meeting in Cebu, Philippines. This event saw the merging of the ASSC sports
activities calendar into one annual games carnival, the ASEAN Schools Games
(ASG).</p>
