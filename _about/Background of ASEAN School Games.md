<p>Since the satellite event in the region was started in 1977 with the 1st
ASEAN Schools Track &amp; Field Championships held in Jakarta, the ASEAN
Schools Sports Council (ASSC) which was formed that year has increased
its yearly sporting calendar over the years to cover 12 sports. The 1st
ASEAN Schools Games in Thailand marked a milestone for ASSC as it moved
from hosting satellite championships to consolidating all the sports into
one yearly major sporting event in a ‘Games’ format.</p>
