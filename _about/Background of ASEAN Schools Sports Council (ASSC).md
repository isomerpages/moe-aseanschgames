<p>The ASEAN Schools Sports Council (ASSC), formed in 1978, is an apolitical
regional organization that promotes sports amongst the ten member countries
- Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.&nbsp; The aim of the Council is to strengthen
international ties, appreciation and understanding among ASEAN member nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The positions of ASSC President and the nine Vice-Presidents (i.e. one
from each member country) are held at Ministerial level.&nbsp; Currently,
Lao PDR holds the Presidency of ASSC and will complete its two-year term
by the end of 2026.&nbsp; By rotation, Malaysia will assume the role of
President from 2027-2028.&nbsp; In addition, the ASSC also maintains a
permanent Treasurer (held by Malaysia), and a Technical Committee which
oversees the rules and provisions for competitions.&nbsp; The Technical
Committee is currently chaired by Singapore, and is represented by Director,
Physical, Sports and Outdoor Education Branch (MOE).&nbsp;</p>
