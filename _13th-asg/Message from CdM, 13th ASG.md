<p>The SSST comprises 102 student-athletes from various schools who have
been training together to give their best. To all the student-athletes
representing the SSST in the four sports, I offer my heartiest congratulation.
You have all worked incredibly hard to get to this point, and I am confident
that you will represent Singapore with pride. I wish you all the best for
the competition, and I look forward to seeing you compete with passion,
determination and sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Singapore Contingent will comprise 35 dedicated officials
supporting in the respective roles as secretariat, team managers, coaches,
medical staff, and media personnel. They all play significant roles in
guiding and caring for the student-athletes. I would like to extend my
deepest appreciation to all for their dedicated service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish the team all the best and letâ€™s look forward to a memorable and
enriching experience.&nbsp;</p>
