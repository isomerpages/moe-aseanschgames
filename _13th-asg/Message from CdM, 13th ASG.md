<p>As Chef de Mission of the 13<sup>th</sup> ASEAN Schools Games (ASG) Singapore
Contingent, I am honoured to lead such a talented and dedicated team with
Mdm Rasidah Bte Rahim, Principal of Clementi Town Secondary School, as
the Deputy Chef de Mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Singapore Schools Sports Team (SSST) is proud and eager to be given
the opportunity to meet our ASEAN friends once again after a four-year
hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ASG is a rare opportunity for
our young athletes to compete against the best youth athletes in the ASEAN
region and make new friends from the member countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SSST comprises 106 student-athletes from various schools who have
been training together to give their best. To all the student-athletes
representing the SSST in the four sports, I offer my heartiest congratulation.
You have all worked incredibly hard to get to this point, and I am confident
that you will represent Singapore with pride. I wish you all the best for
the competition, and I look forward to seeing you compete with passion,
determination and sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Singapore Contingent will comprise 37 dedicated officials
supporting in the respective roles as secretariat, team managers, coaches,
medical staff, and media personnel. They all play significant roles in
guiding and caring for the student-athletes. I would like to extend my
deepest appreciation to all for their dedicated service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish the team all the best and letâ€™s look forward to a memorable and
enriching experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr Chua Lek Hong&nbsp; Chef de Mission&nbsp; 13th ASG Singapore Schools Sports Team&nbsp;</strong>
