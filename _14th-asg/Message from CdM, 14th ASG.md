<p>It is my honour and privilege to lead the Singapore Schools Sports Team
(SSST) at the 14th ASEAN Schools Games (ASG), together with my Deputy Chef
de Mission, Mr Koh Yiak Kheng Leonard, Principal of Marsiling Secondary
School.</p>
<p>The ASG aims to promote ASEAN solidarity among our youth through school
sports, to provide opportunities for student-athletes to benchmark their
sporting talents within the ASEAN region, and to foster cross-cultural
understanding and friendships among ASEAN nations. These ideals remind
us that the Games are not only about winning medals but also about strengthening
bonds and building bridges across borders.</p>
<p>This year, our Singapore contingent comprises 130 student-athletes from
various schools, representing seven sports—an encouraging increase from
last year’s four. Congratulations to each and every student athlete on
your selection. It is a rare and proud honour to don the national colours
and represent our country. You have earned this opportunity through your
dedication, resilience, and hard work, balancing intense training with
your school commitments.</p>
<p>Supporting our athletes is a team of 43 dedicated officials, including
secretariat members, team managers, coaches, medical staff, and media personnel,
all committed to ensuring that every athlete is well-supported and able
to perform at their best.</p>
<p>As you compete, remember that the ASG is not only about sporting excellence
but also about the spirit of friendship, respect, and unity. Compete with
integrity, give your best, and uphold the values of sportsmanship and teamwork.
Above all, carry yourselves as proud ambassadors of Singapore—on and off
the field.</p>
<p>Together, let us embody the spirit of ASEAN solidarity and make Singapore
proud.</p>
<p>Go Team Singapore!</p>
