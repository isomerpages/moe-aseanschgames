<p>The official logo was inspired by the national flower of Brunei Darussalam,
Simpur (Dillenia suffruticosa), locally known as Simpur Bini. The logo
represents values, progress and connection to the natural environment.
Jawi script in the logo reflects Brunei Darussalam as a country with the
concept of Malay Islamic Monarchy. The curve shape symbolises a dynamic
journey of growth, progress and success, represented by the three primary
colour scheme of ASG14.</p>
