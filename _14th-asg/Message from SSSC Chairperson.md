<p>On behalf of the Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC), I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all 130 student-athletes selected to represent the Singapore Schools Sports Team (SSST) at the 14th ASEAN Schools Games (ASG) in Brunei.</p>

<p>The ASG is more than a competition - it is a celebration of youth, talent, and camaraderie. It offers our student-athletes a precious opportunity to test their mettle against the best in the region, to learn from others, and to build friendships that transcend borders.</p>
<p>To all our athletes, I urge you to compete with passion, perseverance, and pride. Embrace this journey not only to win, but to grow - as individuals, teammates, and ambassadors of Singapore. Let the National School Games motto, “Character in Sporting Excellence,” be your guide. Strive to make Singapore proud through your performances, your resilience, and above all, your sportsmanship. I wish you all the best for the competition, and I look forward to seeing you return home with new experiences, friendships and memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>I also wish to express my sincere appreciation to NYSI, the coaches, officials, and parents whose steadfast support and commitment make this experience possible for our student-athletes.</p>
<p>May the 14th ASG be a memorable and inspiring milestone for every one of you. I wish all participants a safe, fulfilling, and exhilarating Games. Let the Games begin!</p>
